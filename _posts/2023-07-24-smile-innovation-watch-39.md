Wow, long time no see!

I feel like I'm saying this every couple of weeks / months when I finally find time to send you this extract of our curation work.

In this edition, we will discuss LLM, OpenAI, and Machine Learning A LOT. Apologies in advance, but their impact on so many of our activities makes it difficult not to have a lot to talk about right now.

Innovation, Privacy, and Acquisition are the topics of this edition, including news about Signal considering stopping service in the UK, Mozilla's latest acquisitions, and Twitter's revenue being... well, not that good.

Welcome to our innovation watch!
