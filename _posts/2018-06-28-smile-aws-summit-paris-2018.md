# Smile @ AWS Summit Paris 2018

AWS Global Summits are free events that bring the cloud computing community together to connect, collaborate, and learn about AWS. Summits are held in major cities around the world, and attract technologists from all industries and skill levels who want to discover how AWS can help them innovate quickly and deliver reliable, flexible solutions at scale.

We participate to the event with 3 points of presence : The ‚ÄúInnovation Corner‚Äù which is a showcase area of innovative use of AWS products, a booth where we showcased two computer vision prototypes and with a keynote from [Alain ROUEN]() and C√©dric Ravalec about a business use cases, still on computer vision.

# OpenFMS

On the Innovation Corner of Amazon Web Services, we had the please to show the public a simpler version of our open-source fleet management system solution our ECS (Embedded and Connected System) team developed based on [ODOO](https://www.odoo.com/), IoT devices connected to trucks (using CAN bus) that send data into AWS where they are aggregated, filtered and computed and made available to ODOO where we integrated dashboards and the entire delivery workflow : from self-checkups of the truck to delivery to clients, through picking up goods and entering your fees (gas, ‚Ä¶) into the system. Everything is real time and we show all of this with a tiny dashboard made just for that event.

# Computer Vision and Alexa

On our booth and at a lightning talk, we demonstrate some proof of concepts around computer vision (and voice recognition, just for the purpose of demonstrating our skills around creating an Alexa skill and trigger it through [Alexa‚Äôs voice service](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service)) and edge computing on [a small Raspberry 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/).

If you are interested about our journey into training computers to recognize food, plates, ‚Ä¶ [Patrice Ferlet]() start to write about it on this publication and more articles are planned to join the series.

This demonstration around food recognition was set up after R&D for a particular use cases: detecting everything you put on your plate, and be able to give you the note, instantly. Something that many companies‚Äô restaurant could be interested to achieve in the next few months/years.

This demonstration will be available at ‚ÄúL‚Äôappart by smile‚Äù our R&D showroom in Asni√®res (Paris, France). People interested to visit it or know more about our activity can get in touch with [Fabien Gasser](mailto:fabien.gasser@smile.fr?subject=L%27appart%20by%20Smile).
