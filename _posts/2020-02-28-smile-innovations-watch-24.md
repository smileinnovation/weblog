Here we are, edition 24. And this is a solid one. So long that when we sent it out, it was too big for Gmail displaying it entirely, and we had to add a disclaimer to inform people they may need to click on ‚Äúopen in a new window‚Äù to see all the content üòÖ.

In this edition, you‚Äôll find your bi-weekly dose of curated content, from drones to the latest privacy leak drama (Hi Facebook! üëã), the constant new area explored by ü§ñ A.I. to the creation of üöß living concrete that is able to reproduce, and, of course, our selection of open-source projects and tools, as well as the latest merge/revenues from the Internet bubble.

That‚Äôs Smile‚Äôs Innovation watch.

### [Facebook is maybe building an entire mobile OS](https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/facebook-operating-system/)

Facebook, well known for its very intrusive apps that read all your texts, call logs, store your location, know who you meet (if they have the FB app too) and who shares pictures with you (by tracking lens defect in photos). Well, Facebook seems to be building an entire mobile OS to avoid having to rely on Google for their products such as Oculus or Portal.

### [Xenobots made by an evolutionary algorithm](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/615041/these-xenobots-are-living-machines-designed-by-an-evolutionary-algorithm/)

They are made from heart and skin cells, and their ‚Äúdesign‚Äù is the result of simulating evolutions and trying millions of combinations using an evolutionary algorithm. Those microscopic robots are made of living tissues and have a lifespan of 10 days to decay afterward finally. One day they will be used to clean microplastics, digest toxic materials, or even deliver drugs inside our bodies (robots you can eat has been a small trend since CES2019).

### [Data extraction using AI](https://rossum.ai/data-capture)

Rossum is a company focusing on data extraction made by AI, and they started to work with but a very, very, very common problem known to all businesses on earth: invoices classification. They let you send them all your invoices, they extract the data and feed your systems: SAP, Microsoft Dynamics, Odoo, Sage, Quickbook ‚Ä¶ you name it. Without a template to train. Impressive, isn‚Äôt it? Well, we are working on similar topics at Smile, just come and let‚Äôs chat üôÉ.

### [Private Equity is going to run .org registrar](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nvjd/private-equity-is-going-to-ruin-the-org-domain-system-and-screw-nonprofits)

Public Interest Registry (PIR), the registrar of .org domain, announced it would be selling to private equity firm Ethos Capital. Of course, PIR is trying to make it sound like a great opportunity. Still, the entire Internet and the open-source world are afraid that the renewal price of .org domain names (which was created for non-profit organizations) will rise. A lot of non-profit org, with an already established online presence, won‚Äôt have a choice but to keep up and pay more or face being deleted from the web.

### [Google wants to kill third-party cookies in Chrome withing two years](https://digiday.com/media/google-plans-kill-off-third-party-cookies-chrome-within-2-years/)

A cookie is a small file a website can put in your computer browser to store data, likely a unique ID, to track you. A 3rd party cookie is the same, but by someone other than the website you‚Äôre visiting, let say the ad network or Youtube (because there‚Äôs a video embedded in the page). That‚Äôs the most common way of tracking people across multiple websites, and it became the most targeted technique for ad blockers for years. Some browsers like Firefox or Brave are even blocking them by default now. But that‚Äôs not without consequences for the ad industry. Google, which is a significant ad network player, is trying a different approach and invite all the ad players to sit together and rethink the way they are targeting people for ad personalization during the next two years before 3rd party cookies will be blocked by default also on Google chrome.

### [Facebook Dating blocked in Europe before its launch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/facebook-dating-launch-blocked-in-europe-after-it-fails-to-show-privacy-workings/)

The good old time when you can launch anything and apologize later is over, and Facebook just learned it the hard way. The launch of their dating services inside Facebook ecosystem has been canceled when EU data regulator said Facebook didn‚Äôt comply with the mandatory (by law) privacy risk assessment (which they didn‚Äôt make) and didn‚Äôt give the legal time to the regulator to inspect the service before its launch. Adding to that, when the services were launched in the US, they were fined by the USA regulator $5billions for privacy issues in the service. A good reminder that GDPR is made **mandatory for everyone** to create a **privacy-by-design** system.

# üí∞ Acquisition

### [Youtube reveals revenues for the first time: $15.1 Bn in 2019](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/youtube-revenue-revealed-video-site-did-151b-2019-ad-revenue-1276004)

For the 1st time, Google published a detailed revenue report. That‚Äôs how we can all see Youtube made $15.1 Bn in 2019, with a solid $3Bn just with Youtube subscription. In 2017, Google CEO told Youtube generated $8.15 billion in ad revenue ($11.15 Bn in 2018). Founded in 2005 and sold to Google in 2006 for $1.65Bn became a gigantic cash machine. Netflix, for comparison, made $20.1 billion in revenue in 2019. Google Cloud generated $8.9 billion in 2019.

### [Sprint & T-Mobile going to merge](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile/t-mobile-sprint-merger-wins-approval-from-us-judge-idUSKBN2042MG)

Despite a claim by a group of states that said the merger would violate antitrust laws and raise prices, the U.S. federal court said they were right to proceed. The goal of this transaction is the hope to better compete with Verizon and AT&T as the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier. Shares of T-Mobile rose 11% and Sprint 74%. Softbank, the controlling shareholder of Sprint, can finally relax since they are getting rid of a troubled asset that was losing subscribers at a fast rate.

# üîì OpenSource

### [Github Archive program will safely store every public Github repo for 1000 years in the Arctic World Archive in Svalbard, Norway](https://archiveprogram.github.com/)

GitHub is partnering with the Long Now Foundation, the Internet Archive, the Software Heritage Foundation, Arctic World Archive, Microsoft Research, the Bodleian Library, and Stanford Libraries to ensure the long-term preservation of the world‚Äôs open-source software. They will protect this priceless knowledge by storing multiple copies, on an ongoing basis, across various data formats and locations, including a very-long-term archive designed to last at least 1,000 years.

### [Bing loser out to DuckDuckGo in Android search engine ballot](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058120/google-android-search-engine-choice-duckduckgo-bing-default-eu-antitrust-ruling)

As enforced by EU regulation, Google is required to let its customers choose when setting up an Android device from March. A choice between several options as the default search engine, including Google. The ‚Äúchoice screen‚Äù is being introduced by an antitrust ruling where the EU fined Google $5 Bn. So Google made a public fourth-price auction where every company tells how much they are willing to pay when a user chooses them as a default search engine per country. DuckDuckGo won almost all countries, but it appears that Microsoft‚Äôs Bing won the UK.

# üå± Sustainability & Society

![Bartender robotic arm cheering with human](/assets/images/posts/0*yS8ZXyu0tboEgvDD.jpg)

### [Robot Bartending company is giving cash to people replaced by their robots](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/robot-bartending-company-automation-stipend/)

Automation is something all financing and society publication tell you will change the world forever. The possible impact of automation, by robots or AI, will have a significant effect on the economic fabric of our society. The company behind Toni, ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs leading robotic bartending system‚Äù is handing $1000 per month to an employee replaced by their system. It‚Äôs still unclear how long it will be paid, but the first beneficiaries of this stipend are already getting money from the company. The company wants to encourage people they are ‚Äúreplacing‚Äù to find a better, more sustainable income for them. It‚Äôs kind of like basic income meeting social responsibility.

![Field sensor](/assets/images/posts/0*CIZiPLhyD1nDqeP5.jpg)

### [Affordable and accurate grower insights](https://www.farm21.tech/)

Precise information about crops and your fields are essential. But IoT systems could be expensive and complex to deploy. Farm21 developed a sensor that costs only 79‚Ç¨ and covers 1.5ha (and LoRa indoor/outdoor gateways). It gives you access to a web platform where you‚Äôll get all the pieces of information about your soils (moisture at a different depth, air & soil temperature, air humidity levels). And it‚Äôs made in üá≥üá±the Netherlands.

### [Gamesnacks are bite-sized html5 games](https://www.gamesnacks.com/)

Content, videos, webpages, and apps are becoming bigger and bigger as our bandwidth increased, and the power of our gadgets rises. But that‚Äôs not a reason to stop making an effort to pursue code simplicity and lightness. That‚Äôs the idea behind game snacks: games which load quickly, even on slow network conditions and on low-memory devices. They should also easy to play to be more accessible to people with cognitive, visual, or muscular disabilities and run everywhere: phones, tablets, desktops, web, or natives.

### [China is using drones to harass people on the street](https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1223218977570078721)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Global Times is the Republic of China‚Äôs state propaganda media.**

With the epidemic spreading in China, the government is using more and more drones to ‚Äúinteract‚Äù with people. From making them pay at the toll to spreading antibacterial over the street and also harassing people to force them to stay at home and to shame them.

![A first try of using Living concrete to create something solid.](/assets/images/posts/0*5K3QksyRBmJbhW0H.jpeg)

### [Living Concrete](https://us18.admin.mailchimp.com/%EF%BF%BC/www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/science/construction-concrete-bacteria-photosynthesis.html)

Scientists created living concrete that can heal itself and even reproduce. Each piece of concrete is drying out when exposed to regular air but can be reactivated with warmth and humidity to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù again. Each piece of concrete can grow three times its size. And the fascinating property of this concrete isn‚Äôt just it‚Äôs alive, but it can be made from waste material like ground glass or recycled concrete. In contrast, ‚Äúregular‚Äù concrete needs virgin sand that comes from rivers, lakes, and oceans.

# üõ† Tools

### [Android phone number library ported in JS](https://catamphetamine.github.io/libphonenumber-js/)

Google Android‚Äôs libphonenumber has been rewritten in a more straightforward and smaller form in javascript. This rewrite tries to focus on being a pure JS framework while the official Google port is tied to closure. It has a smaller footprint too (130kb vs. 530kb), can extract numbers from a string (which Google‚Äôs version can‚Äôt) but don‚Äôt support alphabetic numbers like 1‚Äì800-GOT-MILK nor short number (used for special number or text message services).

### [Resources for Beginner Bug Bounty Hunter](https://github.com/nahamsec/Resources-for-Beginner-Bug-Bounty-Hunters)

Many new hackers are joining the community regularly, and more than often, the first thing they ask is, ‚ÄúHow do I get started and what are some good resources?‚Äù. As a hacker, there a ton of techniques, terminologies, and topics you need to familiarize yourself with to understand how an application works. Cody Brocious [(@daeken)](http://twitter.com/daeken), [@0xAshFox](https://twitter.com/0xAshFox), and [@nahamsec](https://twitter.com/nahamsec) put these resources together to help new hackers with resources to learn the basics of Web Application Security.

### [Github command line is here](https://cli.github.com/)

For the command line lovers who don‚Äôt already use [hub wrapper](https://hub.github.com/), Github released their official CLI. You can check PR status or create one, list all the issues, and dig into the details, checkout a PR, create an issue ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs far from all the things possible with the [hub wrapper](https://hub.github.com/), but it‚Äôs an excellent start.

# üìä Trends

![Cyborg artistic view.](/assets/images/posts/0*a7nrciO3GwtwGi4z.jpg)

### [The U.S.A. Pentagon is working on Cyborg Supersoldiers](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwee47/heres-the-pentagons-terrifying-plan-for-cyborg-supersoldiers))

Determining the potential of machines that are physically integrated within the human body to augment and enhance the performances of the human beings over the next 30 years is the following big field of research for the Department of Defense. We know that DARPA was working for long on the topic of how to ‚Äúrepair‚Äù biological loss for soldiers after deployment on the war zone. Still, now it seems to get a different pace and focus on how to augment human soldiers to get ‚Äústrategic advantage.‚Äù

### [Using A.I. to swipe on Tinder is just that easy](https://mashable.com/article/tinder-hack-bot-ai-dating/?europe=true)

Creating ‚ÄúTinderBot‚Äù isn‚Äôt complicated anymore. Tinder, while they are not providing an API explicitly to developers, is facing more and more people guessing and documenting the way their app is interacting with their servers. More and more developers are maintaining this documentation up-to-date. Some even creating code to interact within a higher level (so they have to update a dependency if the API change). Some have focussed on how to extract pictures of women and train A.I. to swipe and even start a conversation the same wat they will do. Is it creepy? Of course. But it‚Äôs ‚Äúto show Tinder how we did it so they can improve their security.‚Äù üôÑ
