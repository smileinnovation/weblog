New year, New you!
I don‚Äôt know if you notice, but we redesigned the categories of information to better suit what we want to share with you and how we are collecting those Infos. Internally, we are using Trello to collect, categorize, prioritize and create our publication plan. Every people in the Innovation team is able now to vote to push the news in front, creating a more diverse view and topics.
Talking about topics, we are keeping üí°Innovation, üóΩPrivacy & Freedom, üí∞Acquisition and üîìOpenSource. We are very pleased to introduce üå±Sustainability & Society and üìàTrends. With those 2 new categories, we want to give you more food for your thought about the role of technology in our lives. Don‚Äôt worry though, üòÅFun & WTF and üõ†Tools are still here!
