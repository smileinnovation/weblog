### Vivatech was everywhere for 3 days, all the cutting technology was here, accessible to the tech-savvy person you are.

### Welcome to our Vivatech 2019 overview.

Europe more than ever should align its strategy to create unicorns and challenge the vision of the USA and China market by unifying effort with a focus on what Europe has been known for: humanity, vision and innovation.

According to me, it goes by :

* Working way more on **diversity** starting by **promoting Women in Tech**

* **Technology should be used for good** with a positive** impact on the economy, society and humanity**

* **Working with the AfricaTech** market growing stronger every day and probably **the best ally of European growth**.

CAC 40 and the public institution has occupied all the good spots with an impressive demonstration of the glory of open innovation and promoting their champions.

Some happy few startups were absorbing the sun received by the giants, leaving crumbs of attention the thousands of startup waiting to shine.
