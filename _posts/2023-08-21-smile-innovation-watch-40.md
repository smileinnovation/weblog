### [Reddit crashed because of the growing subreddit blackout](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23758002/reddit-crashing-api-protest-subreddit-private-going-dark)

On June 12th, 2023, Reddit experienced a widespread API crash due to a protest by moderators of several subreddits. The moderators made their subreddits private and went dark in response to Reddit's lack of action against hate speech and harassment on the platform. The protest was sparked by the recent rise in hate speech and harassment on the platform, which moderators felt was not being addressed adequately by Reddit's administration.

The API crash affected a large number of third-party apps and services that rely on Reddit's API, causing widespread disruption. Reddit's administration responded to the protest by acknowledging the concerns of the moderators and promising to take action to address hate speech and harassment on the platform. However, the protest continued for several days, with many subreddits remaining private and offline. The incident highlighted the growing importance of moderation and content regulation on social media platforms, and the need for platforms to take a more proactive approach to addressing hate speech and harassment.

### [Hacking my ‚Äúsmart‚Äù toothbrush](https://kuenzi.dev/toothbrush/)

Electrical Engineer Cyrill K√ºnzi reverse engineered his Philips Sonicare toothbrush to understand its mechanism of notifying users when to replace the brush head. He discovered that the brush head contains an NTAG213 NFC tag, which communicates with the toothbrush. The tag contains a unique ID, a link to the Philips store, a color identifier, and a total brush time counter. The brush time counter stores the total number of seconds the brush head has been in use, resetting after 255 seconds.

K√ºnzi found that he could reset the brush time counter by obtaining the password sent over plaintext between the toothbrush and the brush head. He recorded the RF signal communication between the two using a HackRF software defined radio, which revealed the password. With the password, he could use the NFC Tools app to reset the counter. However, each brush head has a unique password, and the brush head permanently disables all write access after three incorrect password attempts.
