Hello world 🌎! As you might (or might not) know Smile Innovation is in charge of watching, ideating, prototyping, evangelizing for both people within the group and Smile’s fellow customers. We chose to get out of press fortnightly (read every two weeks) with a collection of links, press article, press release or announcement, even videos or tweets that caught our attention, with a mix of our own content. We hope you’ll enjoy this issue as much as we loved to prepare it for you.

# Innovation • /ˌɪnəˈveɪʃən/

> Borrowed from Middle French *innovation*, from Old French *innovacion*, from Late Latin *innovatio*, *innovationem*, from Latin *innovo, innovatus*. Something new, and contrary to established customs, manners, or rites.

Federated Learning works through collaborative learning, using de-identified, aggregated information from many devices to improve machine learning models. This is a good example of how all this ML buzz thing could help.

[**Mycroft — Open Source Voice Assistant**](https://mycroft.ai/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch)

Mycroft is an open source voice assistant, that can be installed on Linux, Raspberry Pi, or on the Mark 1 hardware device. Their opensource skills are written in Python. We (Smile) decided to go with [snips](https://snips.ai) and plans to become a certified partner are along the way but still, it’s always interesting to know the competition 🙂

[**MIT wants to control your dreams with a glove](https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2018/04/23/mit-wants-to-control-your-dreams-with-a-glove/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch) — [thenextweb.com**](https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2018/04/23/mit-wants-to-control-your-dreams-with-a-glove/)

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently developed an interface for controlling the state of consciousness between awake and asleep. Well, this is a bit low-tech but quite fun. The key takeaway in our opinion is that all in all we rely on basic signal and sensors for a long time now and most of the innovation happens in crunching and interpreting data.

# Aquisition • /ˌakwɪˈzɪʃ(ə)n/

> From Middle English, borrowed from Old French *acquisicion*, from Latin *acquisītiō*, from *acquirere. *The act or process of acquiring.

[**Flickr just got acquired by SmugMug — so where should your photos go?](https://thenextweb.com/apps/2018/04/23/flickr-just-got-acquired-by-smugmug-so-where-should-you-store-your-photos/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch) **
 Over the weekend, photo hosting platform SmugMug acquired Flickr from Yahoo — sorry, Verizon; merging two companies that have offered similar services for nearly 15 years. So what’s changing, and in which cloud should you stash your photographs?

[**Adobe acquires voice interface platform Sayspring — TechCrunch**](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/adobe-acquires-voice-interface-platform-sayspring/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch)

Adobe announced that it has acquired Sayspring, a startup that helps developers prototype and builds the voice interfaces for their Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant apps. This is interesting because looking at the Dialog Flow and all the Google stack for voice assistant for example, you quickly understand that it’s not made for final users. Will Adobe be able to provide something simple to play with?

# Privacy • /ˈpɹaɪ.və.si/

> The state of being private; the state of not being seen by others.

[**Piwik is now Matomo ](https://matomo.org/blog/2018/01/piwik-is-now-matomo/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch)— [matomo.org**](https://matomo.org/blog/2018/01/piwik-is-now-matomo/)

Piwik, the open source analytics platforms rebrand itself under the name of Matomo after 10 years of creating the biggest open source alternative to Google Analytics.

[**Matomo GDPR Roadmap](https://matomo.org/gdpr-roadmap/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch) — [matomo.org**](https://matomo.org/gdpr-roadmap/)

GDPR is in everyone mouth, and companies that work in a very entangled way with user data may have a hard time to figure out how to deal with it. But not Matamo. In fact, they completely open and publish in a transparent way how they are working on this topic.

# Openness • /ˈəʊ.pən/ + /nəs/

> Accommodating attitude or opinion, as in receptivity to new ideas, behaviors, cultures, peoples, environments, experiences, etc., different from the familiar, conventional, traditional, or one’s own.

[**Titus, the Netflix container management platform, is now open source**](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/titus-the-netflix-container-management-platform-is-now-open-source-f868c9fb5436?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch)

It’s impressive that Netflix decided to release such a huge and important component of their infrastructure. There’s probably a lot to learn in looking at how they did.

[**[FR] Netflix rend open source Titus, sa plate-forme de gestion de conteneurs](https://siecledigital.fr/2018/04/23/netflix-open-source-titus-plateforme-gestion-conteneurs/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch) — [siecledigital.fr**](https://siecledigital.fr/2018/04/23/netflix-open-source-titus-plateforme-gestion-conteneurs/)
 Ils ne s’en doutent peut-être pas, mais tous les 125 millions d’abonnés Netflix connaissent Titus sans le savoir. En effet, cette application d’orchestration de conteneurs alimente les aspects critiques de l’activité Netflix.
