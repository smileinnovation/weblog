Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has reportedly shelved its plans for the Metaverse, a virtual reality platform that was touted as the future of social media.

The reasons for **Meta's decision to abandon the Metaverse** are unclear, but some have speculated that the company may have been deterred by the high costs and technical challenges associated with the project. Others have suggested that the move may be linked to ongoing concerns over the potential negative social and psychological impacts of virtual reality technologies.

### [AI Looks Like a Bubble](http://archive.is/202303/https://every.to/napkin-math/ai-looks-like-a-bubble)

Doesn't AI seems to be the new bubble? With multiple reports of companies raising large valuations despite having no revenue...
Bubbles are when people buy too much unnecessary stuff due to the belief that they can sell it to someone even more ignorant. An example of this is the crypto bubble of 2017 where blockchain companies saw huge gains in stock price as a result of Bitcoin skyrocketing.
While emerging technology can lead to new opportunities, returns from these opportunities are not likely to be distributed equally.

The hangover morning for the automotive industry seems a bit brutal. Before the blockchain and NFT trend, it was the gTLD rush. And many company went to spend $70k per gTLD to become TLD operator. Fiat Chrysler Automotive just filled termination notive for .abart, .alfaromeo, .fiat, .maserati, .lancia.

Previously last year .macys (the general store, ¬± US Gallery Lafayette), .bugatti, .ses (the space satellite company) dropped their gTLD too.

Wouldn't be fun to see cars can't connect to teleservices or get update because of this recent drop ? üòÅ
