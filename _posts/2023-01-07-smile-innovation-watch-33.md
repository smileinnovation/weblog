How to start a new year better than with a tech watch? üòÅ

OK, I agree, I‚Äôm going to be rather parochial on that one. Well, first of all, I want to wish you a happy new year from the encore Cornerstone team. Hoping to see you all stay healthy on this new year.

In this edition, we‚Äôll roll up over the last news, fresh from end-of-December last year: Samsung + IBM new chip design, Huawei going on ‚ö°Ô∏èüöó electric car market, some open source alternative to Google Product, Firefox going to have ads in the search bar ü§ë, Toyota making car owners pay to use key fob (yep üëÄ), screen you can lick üëÖ, experiment on beaming. Energy. On earthüí• (like SimCity didn‚Äôt tell us that‚Äôs a bad, bad, bad idea), and more.
