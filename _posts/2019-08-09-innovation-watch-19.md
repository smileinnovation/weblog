Everyone is on holiday including me üèñ. Let‚Äôs face it.

But it will not prevent us to provide you with your bi-weekly dose of tech news. Let‚Äôs start with a big partnership between NHS & Amazon Alexa, some wise thoughts about robopocalypse and big data, Google and Microsoft privacy issues, Disney launching its streaming offer and more. We spot few fun side projects in #IA and #MachineLearning, #RaspberyPi and #voicerecognition and a Fake News Simulator.

This is Smile‚Äôs Innovation Watch.

### [Swim Goggle with a smart display](https://www.formswim.com/)

Goggles with a smart display are something C√©dric Ravalec, our convergence wizard, and we have been talking for some times. We first came to think about it first for cyclists while working on the Sun Trip Tour / Smile Trip Tour project. We are looking forward to seeing this object emerging in other sports with such a bright idea.

### [Alexa, I feel like sh*t](https://usbeketrica.com/article/la-securite-sociale-britannique-s-allie-a-amazon-pour-conseiller-les-malades)

(Read in üá´üá∑) NHS team up with Amazon to develop Alexa skills to help British people ‚Äúget control over their health again‚Äù instead of going straight to the doctor, you can ask Alexa to guide you through auto medication. As expected, the General Medical Council is not very happy about this, auto medication is never a good choice, and they point out that will reinforce the two-speed medical system, where human interaction will be a luxury. We should note that it is not the first time that the NHS partners with a private company. They already advertise on a have a chatbot when you are calling the emergency number‚Ä¶

### [The optimistic guide to the robot apocalypse](https://qz.com/904285/the-optimists-guide-to-the-robot-apocalypse/)

Maybe like when Queen Elizabeth I denied a patent to an English inventor for the automatic knitting machine, fearing it would lead women (who then just started to be able to make money on their own) to starve due to unemployment. The industrial revolution came anyway, women survived and machines are still thriving in production lines. Then computers became the next threat and now it has shifted to robots. Each time, automatisation lead to more human workers. Perhaps robots are just the new industrial revolution?

### [Data isn‚Äôt the new oil, it‚Äôs the new CO2](https://luminategroup.com/posts/blog/data-isnt-the-new-oil-its-the-new-co2)

[‚Äúeven if you deny consent to ‚Äòyour‚Äô data being used, an organisation can use data about other people to make statistical extrapolations that affect you.‚Äù](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612588/its-time-for-a-bill-of-data-rights/) We are bound by other people‚Äôs consent. Our own consent (or lack thereof) is becoming increasingly irrelevant. We won‚Äôt solve the societal problems pervasive data surveillance is causing by rushing through online consent forms.

### [Google is training its face-unlock algorithm with random people in the street](https://usbeketrica.com/article/pour-google-votre-visage-a-un-prix-5-dollars)

(Read in üá´üá∑) Unlike using video feeds of people, Google is offering 5$ coupons to passersby in exchange for recording their face under different exposures and angles, using a dedicated smartphone and app. To avoid gender and racial bias, Google wants to improve its algorithm to work for all kinds of faces and skin colours by not simply relying on biometric data this time.

### [Microsoft is listening to you too](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xweqbq/microsoft-contractors-listen-to-skype-calls)‚Ä¶

Finally, it seems **EVERYONE** is listening to you through their hardware or software, from smart-speaker to translation engines and even your phones. Microsoft is joining the list of GAFAM who have been spotted doing it. That‚Äôs why, at Smile, we are proud to work with [Snips](https://snips.ai/), offering to our clients, solutions where their voice pattern and records stay in the device.

### [Disney, after acquiring ESPN & 21st Century Fox, launches its streaming service, cheaper than any competitors](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757626/disney-plus-espn-hulu-bundle-price-date-streaming-service)

For 12,99$ a month, Disney launches bundled services including ESPN+ (the sports streaming platform they bought earlier), Hulu as a 3rd party partner (not the pricier plan of Hulu but the ad-supported one) and Disney+ which is a merge between Disney Legacy catalogue and 21st Century Fox. The company will bring this at the international level (while Hulu is only available to the USA at the moment) and wants to directly compete with Netflix, Apple, Amazon and also Youtube and Twitch.

### [Yelp is doing something very shady with over Restaurant](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjwebw/yelp-is-sneakily-replacing-restaurants-phone-numbers-so-grubhub-can-take-a-cut)

Yelp is a well known and used service operating worldwide but mostly in the USA, while Europe is using Foursquare or Google Maps. It lists nice places, like restaurants, and allow you yo rate them, know their opening hours, menu and phone number to make an order or book sits. But they also partnered with Grubhub which is an Uber Eat like platform (which pays more fairly the delivery men and women) and which offers services to restaurants like delivery (obviously) and also ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù. The thin is, Yelp now replaced all restaurants phone number with the Grubhub one, which operates a transparent call forwarding for the user but will end up in charging 15 to 20% of your order to the restaurant. üòà

### [Apple Card is rolling out, but what‚Äôs its level of awesomeness?](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20756048/apple-card-availability-sign-up-cancel-apr-iphone-goldman-sachs)

Let‚Äôs start by telling you that Apple Card is only available in the US. Mainly because it‚Äôs ‚Äújust‚Äù a white label facade from Goldman Sachs by Mastercard. Also, it offers cashback which is complex to implement in Europe, mainly because the EU limits the price banks can charge for a transaction to 1% of its amount. Last but not least, there‚Äôs no way to get your data out of Apple Wallet app, while EU regulation through [PSD2](https://www.ey.com/lu/en/newsroom/pr-activities/articles/article_20180718-la-psd2-un-petit-pas-pour-le-paiement-un-grand-pas-pour-l-open-banking) enforces **Open Banking**. Oh, and if enrolling is just a few taps away, closing your credit line will still require you to contact Goldman Sachs or go physically to one of their venues.

### [How do the 3 seashells works?](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/build-demolition-mans-verbal-morality-ticketing-machine/)

OK, so you want to be that cool guy playing with a raspberry pi zero but don‚Äôt know what to do with it except using it as a [network-wide adblocker](https://pi-hole.net/)? Here‚Äôs my personal pet project: Demolition Man‚Äôs verbal morality ticketing machine! All you need is a pi zero, a thermal printer, and the will to play with voice recognition (with Google Voice Services, sorry guys).
