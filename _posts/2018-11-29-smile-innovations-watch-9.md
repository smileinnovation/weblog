# Smile Innovation’s Watch — #9

Winter is coming ❄️🌨🧟‍♂️ (not so private jokes already used 1,934,324 times this month) and you may already have been wearing back your 🧤gloves and 🧣scarf (especially if you’re using an on-demand electric scooter). When you’ll be comfortable in your office or home, warm and while taking a sip of hot chocolate/coffee/tea, take few minutes to check out our selection of links, trends and, for the first time, some useful tools at the end of the newsletter.

We are gonna tell you about a foldable phone, exoskeleton, AI, a camera with 16 lenses and how to spy on your Airbnb guests.

This is Smile’s Innovation watch.

Samsung just revealed a new concept of phone, which is also a tablet, because it’s foldable. Yes, you read it well. Foldable. And Google already announces Android compatibility with all the next foldable phones that will be released in the next years (months?). 😮

A multi-lens and multi-sensor camera. The camera has 16 camera modules, yes, **16**, designed to capture **52 MP** images using multiple apertures. 📸And letting you do the rendering after. Even decided the depth of the field of vision. And re-rendering the entire photo every single time you zoom in or out for keeping Max quality. Thanks to AI.
