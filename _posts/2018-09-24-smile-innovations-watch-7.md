### [**LTE Beacon for asset tracking**](https://blog.estimote.com/post/177348177680/estimote-lte-m-beacon?utm_campaign=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Estimote believes app of the future won’t be downloaded to phones, computers or tablets. Developers of tomorrow will use the physical world as their playground and build apps into physical objects. After creating beacons with embeddable programs, they just release a supercharged beacon with long-lasting batteries, GPS and 4G cellular connection added to the Bluetooth low energy and NFC capabilities.

### [**Redesigning social interactions on iOS**](https://uxdesign.cc/redesigning-social-interactions-on-ios-with-imessage-17e9c8fa314?gi=6c56dae309ca&utm_campaign=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Apple introduced a lot of new features in their last major update of iOS. But the iMessage app, its ecosystem and mini app remains nearly untouched. A user experience expert decides to go after it and try to improve the global usability of all of this.

You couldn’t had missed this. Apple became the first modern tech company to value over $1 trillion. From $350 millions 7 years ago, how Apple could have reach that insane goal ? And what’s now to accomplish for the tech company ?

# Privacy • /ˈpɹaɪ.və.si/

### [**The death of Don Draper**](https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2018/07/death-don-draper?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=densediscovery)

Advertising, once a creative industry, is now a data-driven business reliant on algorithms. The implications are deeply sinister — not only for the consumer but for democracy itself.

# Openness • /ˈəʊ.pən/ + /nəs/

ZeroPhone by Arsenij Pichugin starts back in January 2017 when the hardware was in a far less mature state than today. Now, the project looks very promising and we are close enough to something that you would like to build and use.
