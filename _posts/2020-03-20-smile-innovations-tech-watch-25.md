Ask anyone in the space business, and they‚Äôll tell you that orbital debris is a serious problem that will only get worse, but dealing with it is as much an opportunity as it is a problem.

### [Equifax hacked by Chinese military officers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131362/doj-justice-barr-china-equifax-breach)

For those who are not familiar with that name, Equifax is one of the biggest credit score providers in the USA. In this country, the credit score is used not for banks, but anyone from your insurer, landlord, phone company, or employer (42% of them do) can use it. People have a free credit report (but not access their score) every year, and you don‚Äôt know how those companies calculate it. Wanting to know your credit score has an impact on your credit score too. Hackers started in May 2017, exploiting a vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework used by Equifax. [**The massive breach exposed names, Social Security numbers**](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/7/16270808/equifax-data-breach-us-identity-theft), birthdates, addresses, and, in some cases, driver‚Äôs license numbers, with credit card numbers for more than 200,000 people and other personally identifying information for approximately 182,000 people also compromised.

Google has disclosed a nightmare of a security and privacy bug affecting Google Photos users: for a time, private videos could be downloaded by unrelated users.

### [How Google Got Its Employees to Eat Their Vegetables](https://onezero.medium.com/how-google-got-its-employees-to-eat-their-vegetables-a2206820d90d)

Google‚Äôs free food is a well-known perk, both in and beyond Silicon Valley. For some time now, Google has been quietly adding a (virtuous) new wrinkle to its food program: It‚Äôs no longer enough just to keep its employees happy; it‚Äôs trying to make them healthy, too. Over the past five years, the company has taken a typically Google-ish approach to the food it serves ‚Äî methodical, iterative ‚Äî to create the largest and most ambitious real-world test of how to nudge people to make healthier choices at mealtime.

### [Cost Cutting Algorithms Are Making Your Job Search a Living Hell](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pkekvb/cost-cutting-algorithms-are-making-your-job-search-a-living-hell)

More companies are using automated job screening systems to vet candidates, forcing job seekers to learn new and absurd tricks to have their r√©sum√©s seen by a human. It seems online seminars about how ‚ÄúBeating the Applicant Tracking System‚Äù are a thing now ‚Ä¶

### [IKEA gave Dubai customers discounts based on their Google Maps travel times](https://www.engadget.com/2020/02/13/ikea-dubai-customers-discount-google-maps-travel-time/)

The feature is called ‚Äú*Buy with your time*‚Äù. Using Google Maps [**Timeline**](https://www.engadget.com/2015/07/22/google-maps-shows-what-it-knows-about-everywhere-youve-ever-b/), which records routes taken every day, customers can show staff at IKEA how long it‚Äôs taken them to get there, and customers can convert that time into cash. Working on IKEA‚Äôs Dubai prices, though, this means shoppers traveling for 49 minutes could get a free Lack coffee table, while a more extended one hour and 55-minute trip would be the equivalent of a Billy bookcase. Even a five-minute trip is suitable for a veggie hotdog.

### [Wuhan Kids Give Bad Ratings to Homework-Assigning App to Remove It from App Store](https://interestingengineering.com/wuhan-kids-give-bad-ratings-to-homework-assigning-app-to-remove-it-from-app-store)

Ah, kids! They‚Äôre wonderful and creative, especially when it comes to getting out of schoolwork. While COVID19 is at his peak in China, kids confined at home are told to use an app to check-in and attend online classes, get homework, and report for it. But they find out that if an app rating falls at 1 star, the app is removed from the App Store. Tens of thousands of reviews flooded in, and DingTalk (that the app name used in China)‚Äôs rating plummeted overnight from 4.9 to 1.4.

### [Open Source Password Manager for Teams](https://www.passbolt.com/)

Free, open-source and self-hosted, extensible, and based on OpenPGP. It uses GnuPG to authenticate users and verify secrets server-side, got a JSON API for password automation, and deployable through Docker. That sounds like an excellent alternative to 1Password for teams (which is free during the COVID outbreak ). Made in Luxembourg!

For seven years, Ikea has treated the smart home as a hobby. That‚Äôs changing now that Bj√∂rn Block‚Äôs Home Smart division has been promoted to the same importance as Living Room, Bedroom, and all the other Ikea businesses that have come to define the company. Ikea faces the challenge of teaming up with Google, Amazon, Apple, and other tech giants while also battling them for primacy in the home.
