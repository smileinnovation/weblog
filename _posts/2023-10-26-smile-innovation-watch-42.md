### [Posture Pal - Improve your posture with your AirPods](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/posture-pal-2)

Posture Pal is an app aimed at enhancing neck and shoulder posture by leveraging the motion sensors in Apple's AirPods. Upon initiating a "Posture Session," it monitors your neck tilt, alerting you of unfavorable posture even in the app's background operation.

It employs playful characters‚ÄîRafi the Giraffe, Haru the Monkey, and Paca the Alpaca‚Äîfor subtle posture reminders, appearing on your Mac screen when needed. The app allows sensitivity adjustment for posture detection, setting an alert delay, and choosing the reminder's on-screen location.

Designed for user-friendliness, it avoids complicated screens or constant notifications; you start the app and forget about it, receiving reminders only when your posture needs correction. Posture Pal not only addresses posture concerns effectively but also showcases an additional utility for Apple's AirPods, providing a novel way to utilize their motion sensors for posture monitoring.

### [Why We Don‚Äôt Ship Software as Fast as We Used To](https://every.to/p/why-we-don-t-ship-software-as-fast-as-we-used-to)

The article discusses the perception that software development has become bloated, overengineered, and slow. The author argues that while software has become more complex, this is due to the increasing demands and expectations of users, such as higher screen resolutions and larger file sizes. Additionally, the author suggests that the growth of software development teams and the use of abstractions has made it more difficult to know the full stack of a project, which can slow down development. However, larger teams are able to do more and ship faster, even if they are not as fast as smaller teams.

### [Google.com tests a news-filled homepage, just like Bing and Yahoo](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/google-com-tests-a-news-filled-homepage-just-like-bing-and-yahoo/)

Google is testing a new version of its homepage in India, which features a newsfeed similar to the Google Discover newsfeed found on the Google mobile app. The homepage experiment includes rows of news articles that Google has algorithmically detected will interest users, as well as "at a glance" cards featuring sports scores, stocks, and the weather. The change makes Google look busier and more like Bing and Yahoo. The experiment could go nowhere and might never see a wide launch, or it could be an optional setting or alternative mode of Google.com, with the traditional white page still as an option.

The mobile app and desktop website are currently very different, but if Google Discover has a business reason to exist on the mobile app, the same justification should apply to Google.com. With Google's willingness to sacrifice old traditions in the name of revenue, a big change to the homepage may finally happen.

### [GitHub Copilot Loses an Average of $20 Per User Per Month](https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/290661/report-github-copilot-loses-an-average-of-20-per-user-per-month)

Big Tech companies are facing high costs in delivering AI capabilities to their customers, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Even paid services are losing money, with Microsoft's GitHub Copilot service costing the company an average of $20 per user per month, and some users costing as much as $80 per month. As a result, Microsoft is developing its own in-house AI chipsets for use in its data centres and is pushing the PC industry to adopt Neural Processing Units (NPUs) that accelerate AI operations independently of the CPU. This will enable PCs to offload some AI tasks from the cloud and process them locally, reducing expenses on the backend.

Adobe has solved the problem of high costs with its Firefly generative AI tools, which are profitable. The company slows down the service's performance on a per-user basis once that user has gone over their monthly credit allotment, which is based on the price they pay Adobe each month. Microsoft is also looking at shorter-term solutions for the costs of AI, including using less powerful backend services that don't cost as much to run.
