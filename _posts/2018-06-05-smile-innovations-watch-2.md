[**Introducing CloudEvents 0.1**](https://medium.com/@austencollins/introducing-cloudevents-a758c62c76bf?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch)

The CNCF is incubating a new specification: cloudevents, that aims to standardize event based message between cloud providers. Why is it a big deal? With the rise of IoT and the serverless movement, it could simplify developers life!

### [WWDC 2018: Everything Apple announced at its annual developer conference](https://thenextweb.com/apple/2018/06/04/wwdc-2018-everything-apple-announced-at-its-annual-developer-conference/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch)

Once a year Apple invites all iOS, TVOS, MacOS developers to gather on a big event called WWDC (World Wide Developer Conference). It‚Äôs always a good opportunity for them to inform people about various upcoming software features on their devices. This year, the focus was on Augmented Reality 2.0, Machine Learning, Siri Shortcuts (to talk only about iOS). The next version of MacOS will be named Mojave and will bring a dark mode and improved and enhanced continuity features.

# Aquisition ‚Ä¢ /Àåakw…™Ààz…™ É(…ô)n/

> From Middle English, borrowed from Old French *acquisicion*, from Latin *acquisƒ´ti≈ç*, from *acquirere*. The act or process of acquiring.

[**Adobe to acquire Magento for $1.68B**](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/adobe-to-acquire-magento-for-1-6-b/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch)

Adobe is consolidating its power in the field of website production by filling the gap in terms of online retailing solution. Adobe Experience didn‚Äôt quite allow you to run a proper business online so Magento jump on board to help Adobe reach new customers & market.

# Privacy ‚Ä¢ /Ààp…πa…™.v…ô.si/

> The state of being private; the state of not being seen by others.

### [Hidden behind vocal assistants, humans may be listening](https://www.laquadrature.net/fr/temoin_cortana?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch)

If you are familiar with *La quadrature du net* you will not be surprised by the tone of the article. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs interesting to (re)think how we are building our products, especially when they are handling so much (very) private user data. That‚Äôs why we, at Smile, we also chose to work with open-source technology and work to teach our customers about privacy issues.

[**Snips : Privacy by design voice assistant, running off-cloud**](https://snips.ai/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch)

Snips is the first Voice Platform where you can build a Voice Assistant that is Private by Design.

Recently Snips announced an upcoming ICO to build an ecosystem where contributors get paid when the help enhance the system by either adding news skills to the skills store or when they help train new models. In addition Snips also [announced](https://medium.com/snips-ai/snips-air-a-private-by-design-open-source-decentralized-voice-assistant-a31e27fb799b) Snips Air, a [private-by-design decentralized voice assistant](https://air.snips.ai/) where pieces of the system (understand different IoT objects) collaborate to solve your intents. They plan on creating pieces of hardware themselves (Air Base and Air Satellites) by collaborating with makers. This is all pretty neat and exciting.

# Openness ‚Ä¢ /Àà…ô ä.p…ôn/ + /n…ôs/

> Accommodating attitude or opinion, as in receptivity to new ideas, behaviors, cultures, peoples, environments, experiences, etc., different from the familiar, conventional, traditional, or one‚Äôs own.

It‚Äôs interesting how I (Fabrice) feel exactly like this. What refrains me the most about voice assistants is giving orders. As a manager, I always tend to kindly ask, why should I suddenly be so authoritative?

# Brand New ‚Ä¢ /b…πand/ + /njuÀê/

> Utterly new, as new as possible

Following the SO-LO-MO (stands for Social, Local & Mobile), Tinder release Places (only in Sidney, Brisbane & Santiago), a new way to discover people that go on the same (public) places than you. Creepy or Genius? They seem to have covered their users against possible stalkers using some privacy by design features.

### [Airbnb Stories](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/airbnb-stories?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=Smile%20Innovation%27s%20Watch)

# Rest in Peace ‚Ä¢ /…π…õst/ + /…™n/ + /piÀês/

The population information & alert system: an essential system, weakened by a lack of ambition and usage of proprietary solutions with few interoperability possibilities, and an undersized IT infrastructure.
