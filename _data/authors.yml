    description: What do they got in there? King Kong? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Life finds a way. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Yes, Yes, without the oops! Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?
